Explanation:
The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140 mEq. To convert from 140 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. 
The concentration of bun is 14.01 mg/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 80 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 140.0 + (14.01 / 2.8) + (14.01 / 18) = 289.448 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 289.448 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 289.448 mOsm/kg.

Explanation:
The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. 
The concentration of bun is 5.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bun from mmol to mg. The mass of bun is 5.0 mmol. To convert 5.0 mmol of bun to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 5.0 mmol bun * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol bun. To convert from mol bun to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol bun * 28.02 g/mol = 0.14 g bun. To convert 0.14 g of bun to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.14 g bun * 1000.0 mg/g = 140.0 mg bun. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 140.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 14.0 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 5.0 mmol bun/L converts to 14.0 mg bun/dL. 
The concentration of glucose is 4.44 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 4.44 mmol. To convert 4.44 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.44 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.721 g glucose. To convert 0.721 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.721 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 721.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 721.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 72.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 4.44 mmol glucose/L converts to 72.1 mg glucose/dL. 
Plugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 140.0 + (14.0 / 2.8) + (14.0 / 18) = 289.006 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 289.006 mmol/L. This is equalivalent to 289.006 mOsm/kg.
