## Reproducing Main Results 






## License 

Depending on the calculator, our dataset consists of notes that were either designed from templated-based functions implemented in Python, handwritten by clinicians, or taken from our data Open-Patients. 

Open-Patients is an aggregated dataset of 180k patient notes coming from three different sources. We have authorization to use the dataset from all three sources. The first source is the USMLE questions from MedQA which is released under the MIT License. 
The second source of our dataset are the Trec Clinical Decision Support and Trec Clinical Trial which are available for redistribution because they are both government-owned datasets released to the public. Lastly, PMC-Patients is released under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license and so we have permission to incorporate PMC-Patients inside Open-Patients and MedCalc-Bench, but the dataset must be released under the same lisense. Hence, our source of notes, Open-Patients, and the dataset curated from it, MedCalc-Bench, are both released under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. 

Based on the justification of license rules, both Open-Patients and MedCalc-Bench comply with the license CC-BY-SA 4.0, but the authors of this paper will bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights.

Ethics Statement
For curating the patient notes in MEDCALC-BENCH, we only use publicly available patient notes272
from published case report articles in PubMed Central and clinician-generated anonymous patient273
vignettes. As such, no identifiable personal health information is revealed in this study.274
While MEDCALC-BENCH is designed to evaluate the medical calculation capabilities of LLMs, it275
should be noted that the dataset is not intended for direct diagnostic use or medical decision-making276
without review and oversight by a clinical professional. Individuals should not change their health277
behavior solely on the basis of our study.278
Broader Impacts279
As described in Sec 1, medical calculators are commonly used in the clinical setting. With the rapidly280
growing interest in using LLMs for domain-specific applications, healthcare practitioners might281
directly prompt chatbots like ChatGPT to perform medical calculation tasks. However, the capabilities282
of LLMs in these tasks are currently unknown. Since healthcare is a high-stakes domain and wrong283
medical calculations can lead to severe consequences, including misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment284
plans, and potential harm to patients, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the performance of LLMs in285
medical calculations. Surprisingly, the evaluation results on our MEDCALC-BENCH dataset show286
that all the studied LLMs struggle in the medical calculation tasks. The most capable model GPT-4287
achieves only 50% accuracy with one-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting. As such, our288
study indicates that current LLMs are not yet ready to be used for medical calculations.289
It should be noted that while high scores on MEDCALC-BENCH do not guarantee excellence in290
medical calculation tasks, failing in this dataset indicates that the models must not be considered291
for such purposes at all. In other words, we believe that passing MEDCALC-BENCH should be a292
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a model to be used for medical calculation

## Maintenance and Responsibility 

Any additional new notes for new or existing calculators, will be updated both on this Github under the ground_truth_csv and the HuggingFace link.
