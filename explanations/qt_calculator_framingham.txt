Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is computed as  QTc = QT Interval + (154 * (1 - rr_interval_sec)), where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 75 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 400 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/75 = 0.8.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 400/(154 * ( 1- 0.8 )) = 430.8.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 430.8 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is computed as  QTc = QT Interval + (154 * (1 - rr_interval_sec)), where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 350 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/60 = 1.0.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 350/(154 * ( 1- 1.0 )) = 350.0.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 350.0 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Framingham formula is computed as  QTc = QT Interval + (154 * (1 - rr_interval_sec)), where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 450 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/90 = 0.667.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 450/(154 * ( 1- 0.667 )) = 501.282.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 501.282 msec.
