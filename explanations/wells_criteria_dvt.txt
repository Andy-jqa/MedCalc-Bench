Explanation:
The current Well's DVT Score is 0.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'active cancer,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 0 + 1 =  1.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'bedridden recently >3 days,' is present. From the patient's note, the issue, 'major surgery within 12 weeks,' is present. Based on the Well's DVT rule, at least one of the issues, 'bedridden recently >3 days' or 'major surgery within 12 weeks' must be true for this criteria to be met for the score to increase by 1. Because this is the case, we incease the score by one making the total 1 + 1 = 2.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'calf swelling >3 cm compared to the other leg,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 2 + 1 =  3.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'collateral (nonvaricose) superficial veins present,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 3 + 1 =  4.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'entire leg swollen,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 4 + 1 =  5.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'localized tenderness along the deep venous system,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 5 + 1 =  6.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'pitting edema, confined to symptomatic leg,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 6 + 1 =  7.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremity,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 7 + 1 =  8.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'previously documented DVT,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 8 + 1 =  9.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'alternative diagnosis to DVT as likely or more likely,' is present. By the Well's DVT rule, we decrease the score by 2 and so total is 9 - 2 = 7.
The Well's DVT score for the patient is 7.

Explanation:
The current Well's DVT Score is 0.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'active cancer,' is absent. By the Well's DVT rule, a point should not be given, and so the score remains unchanged and so total remains at 0.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'bedridden recently >3 days,' is present. The issue,'major surgery within 12 weeks,' is missing from the patient note and so the value is assumed to be absent from the patient. Based on the Well's DVT rule, at least one of the issues, 'bedridden recently >3 days' or 'major surgery within 12 weeks' must be true for this criteria to be met for the score to increase by 1. Because this is the case, we incease the score by one making the total 0 + 1 = 1.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'calf swelling >3 cm compared to the other leg,' is absent. By the Well's DVT rule, a point should not be given, and so the score remains unchanged and so total remains at 1.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'collateral (nonvaricose) superficial veins present,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 1 + 1 =  2.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'entire leg swollen,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 2 + 1 =  3.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'localized tenderness along the deep venous system,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 3 + 1 =  4.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'pitting edema, confined to symptomatic leg,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 4 + 1 =  5.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremity,' is absent. By the Well's DVT rule, a point should not be given, and so the score remains unchanged and so total remains at 5.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'previously documented DVT,' is present. By Well's DVT rule, a point should be given, and so we increment the score by one, making the the total 5 + 1 =  6.
From the patient's note, the issue, 'alternative diagnosis to DVT as likely or more likely,' is absent. By the Well's DVT rule, a point should not be given, and so the score remains unchanged and so total remains at 6.
The Well's DVT score for the patient is 6.
