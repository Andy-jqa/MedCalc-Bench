Explanation:
The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day.
The patient's dose of Codeine is 15 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Codeine. This means that the patient takes 15 mg/dose Codeine * 2 dose/day = 30 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Codeine, multiply the 30 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.15 mme/mg, giving us 4.5 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Codeine to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 4.5 = 4.5 mme/day.
The patient's dose of FentaNYL buccal is 100 µg.
The patient takes 1 doses/day of FentaNYL buccal. This means that the patient takes 100 µg/dose FentaNYL buccal * 1 dose/day = 100 µg/day. To convert to mme/day of FentaNYL buccal, multiply the 100 µg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.13 mme/µg, giving us 13.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of FentaNYL buccal to the total mme/day gives us 4.5 + 13.0 = 17.5 mme/day.
The patient's mme/day is 17.5 mme/day.
Explanation:
The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day.
The patient's dose of HYDROcodone is 15 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of HYDROcodone. This means that the patient takes 15 mg/dose HYDROcodone * 2 dose/day = 30 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROcodone, multiply the 30 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 30 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of HYDROcodone to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 30 = 30 mme/day.
The patient's dose of HYDROmorphone is 100 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of HYDROmorphone. This means that the patient takes 100 mg/dose HYDROmorphone * 1 dose/day = 100 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of HYDROmorphone, multiply the 100 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 5 mme/mg, giving us 500 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of HYDROmorphone to the total mme/day gives us 30 + 500 = 530 mme/day.
The patient's dose of Methadone is 25 mg. The patient takes 3 doses/day of Methadone. This means that the patient takes 25 mg/dose Methadone * 3 dose/day = 75 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Methadone, multiply the 75 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 4.7 mme/mg, giving us 352.5 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Methadone to the total mme/day gives us 530 + 352.5 = 882.5 mme/day.
The patient's mme/day is 882.5 mme/day.
Explanation:
The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day.
The patient's dose of Morphine is 15 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Morphine. This means that the patient takes 15 mg/dose Morphine * 2 dose/day = 30 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Morphine, multiply the 30 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 30 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Morphine to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 30 = 30 mme/day.
The patient's dose of OxyCODONE is 100 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of OxyCODONE. This means that the patient takes 100 mg/dose OxyCODONE * 1 dose/day = 100 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of OxyCODONE, multiply the 100 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1.5 mme/mg, giving us 150.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of OxyCODONE to the total mme/day gives us 30 + 150.0 = 180.0 mme/day.
The patient's dose of OxyMORphone is 25 mg. The patient takes 3 doses/day of OxyMORphone. This means that the patient takes 25 mg/dose OxyMORphone * 3 dose/day = 75 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of OxyMORphone, multiply the 75 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 3 mme/mg, giving us 225 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of OxyMORphone to the total mme/day gives us 180.0 + 225 = 405.0 mme/day.
The patient's mme/day is 405.0 mme/day.
Explanation:
The curent Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) is 0 MME per day.
The patient's dose of Tapentadol is 15 mg. The patient takes 2 doses/day of Tapentadol. This means that the patient takes 15 mg/dose Tapentadol * 2 dose/day = 30 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Tapentadol, multiply the 30 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.4 mme/mg, giving us 12.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Tapentadol to the total mme/day gives us 0 + 12.0 = 12.0 mme/day.
The patient's dose of TraMADol is 100 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of TraMADol. This means that the patient takes 100 mg/dose TraMADol * 1 dose/day = 100 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of TraMADol, multiply the 100 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.2 mme/mg, giving us 20.0 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of TraMADol to the total mme/day gives us 12.0 + 20.0 = 32.0 mme/day.
The patient's mme/day is 32.0 mme/day.
