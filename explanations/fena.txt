Explanation:
The formula for computing the FEna percentage is (creatinine * urine_sodium)/(sodium * urine_creatinine) * 100, where creatinine is the concentration in mg/dL, urine sodium is the concentration in mEq/L, sodium is the concentration mEq/L, and urine creatinine is the concentration in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. 
The concentration of creatinine is 99.89 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 99.89 µmol. To convert 99.89 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 99.89 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 9.99e-05 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 9.99e-05 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.011 g creatinine. To convert 0.011 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.011 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 11.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 11.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.1 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 99.89 µmol creatinine/L converts to 1.1 mg creatinine/dL. 
The concentration of urine creatinine is 2000 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of urine creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of urine creatinine is 2000 µmol. To convert 2000 µmol of urine creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 2000 µmol urine creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.002 mol urine creatinine. To convert from mol urine creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol urine creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.226 g urine creatinine. To convert 0.226 g of urine creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.226 g urine creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 226.0 mg urine creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 226.0 mg urine creatinine/10.0 dL = 22.6 mg urine creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 2000 µmol urine creatinine/L converts to 22.6 mg urine creatinine/dL. 
The concentration of urine sodium is 130 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of urine sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of urine sodium is 130 mmol. The compound, urine sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 130 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 130 mEq urine sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130 mmol urine sodium/L converts to 130.0 mEq urine sodium/L. 
Plugging in these values, we get 100 * (1.1 * 130.0)/(140.0 * 22.6) = 4.52 % FENa.
Hence, the patient's FEna percentage is 4.52 %.

Explanation:
The formula for computing the FEna percentage is (creatinine * urine_sodium)/(sodium * urine_creatinine) * 100, where creatinine is the concentration in mg/dL, urine sodium is the concentration in mEq/L, sodium is the concentration mEq/L, and urine creatinine is the concentration in mg/dL.
The concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of creatinine is 1.13 mg/dL. 
The concentration of urine creatinine is 22.62 mg/dL. 
The concentration of urine sodium is 130 mEq/L. 
Plugging in these values, we get 100 * (1.13 * 130)/(140.0 * 22.62) = 4.639 % FENa.
Hence, the patient's FEna percentage is 4.639 %.
