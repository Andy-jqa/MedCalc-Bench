Explanation:
To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL).
The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of Albmumin is 3.0 g/dL. 
The concentration of Calcium is 10.0 mg/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.0 g/dL)) + 10.0 mg/dL = 10.8 mg/dL.
The patient's corrected calcium concentration 10.8 mg/dL.

Explanation:
To compute the patient's correct calcium level in mg/dL, the formula is  (0.8 * (Normal Albumin (in g/dL) - Patient's Albumin (in g/dL))) + Serum Calcium (in mg/dL).
The patient's normal albumin level is 4.0 g/dL.
The concentration of Albmumin is 30.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 30.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.0 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 30.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 3.0 g Albmumin/dL. 
The concentration of Calcium is 2.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Calcium from mmol to mg. The mass of Calcium is 2.5 mmol. To convert 2.5 mmol of Calcium to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.5 mmol Calcium * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol Calcium. To convert from mol Calcium to grams, multiply by the molar mass 40.08 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol Calcium * 40.08 g/mol = 0.12 g Calcium. To convert 0.12 g of Calcium to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.12 g Calcium * 1000.0 mg/g = 120.0 mg Calcium. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 120.0 mg Calcium/10.0 dL = 12.0 mg Calcium/dL. The concentration value of 2.5 mmol Calcium/L converts to 12.0 mg Calcium/dL. 
Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.0 g/dL)) + 12.0 mg/dL = 12.8 mg/dL.
The patient's corrected calcium concentration 12.8 mg/dL.
