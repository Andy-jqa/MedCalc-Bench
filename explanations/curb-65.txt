Explanation:
The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points.
The patient is 66 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
Because the patient has confusion, 1 point is added to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The concentration of BUN is 8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 8 mmol. To convert 8 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 8 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.008 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.008 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.224 g BUN. To convert 0.224 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.224 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 224.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 224.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 22.4 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 8 mmol BUN/L converts to 22.4 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient's respiratory rate is 56 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.
The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 85 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 55 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because at least one of these statements is true, 1 point is added to score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5.
The patient's Curb-65 score is 5.

Explanation:
The Curb-65 score is current at 0 points.
The patient is 63 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0.
Because the patient does not have confusion, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the score at 0.
The concentration of BUN is 6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 6 mmol. To convert 6 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 6 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.006 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.006 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.168 g BUN. To convert 0.168 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.168 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 168.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 168.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 16.8 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 6 mmol BUN/L converts to 16.8 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is less than or equal to 19 mg/dL and so 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total at 0.
The patient's respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is greater than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 0.
The patient's systiolic blood pressure is 91 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 61 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 0.
The patient's Curb-65 score is 0.
