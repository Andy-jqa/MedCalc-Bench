Explanation:
The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.
The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 15 years old. The patient's is a Female.
The patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6.
The patient's weight is 90.72 kg. The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mmol/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 90.72 * (139.0/140 - 1) = -0.389 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.389 L.

Explanation:
The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.
The patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.
The patient is 67 years old. The patient's is a Male.
The patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly male's, the total body water percentage value is 0.50.
The patient's weight is 200 lbs so this converts to 200 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 90.718 kg. The concentration of sodium is 155.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 155.0 mEq. To convert from 155.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 155.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 155.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 155.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 155.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 155.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 90.718 * (155.0/140 - 1) = 4.86 L. The patient's free body water deficit is 4.86 L.
