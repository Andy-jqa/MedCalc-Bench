Explanation:
The current count of PERC criteria met is 0.
The patient is 50 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 50 years, and so we increment the perc critieria met by 1, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient's heart rate is 120 beats per minute. The patient's heart rate is greater than or equal to 100 beats per minute, and so we increment the perc critieria met by 1, making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
The saturated oxygen percentage in the room is 94 percent. The saturated oxygen is less than 95%, and so we increment the perc critieria met by 1, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient note reports 'unilateral leg swelling' to be present for the patient and so we increment the criteria count by 1, making the current total 3 + 1  =  4.
The patient note reports 'hemoptysis' to be present for the patient and so we increment the criteria count by 1, making the current total 4 + 1  =  5.
The patient note reports 'recent surgery or trauma' to be present for the patient and so we increment the criteria count by 1, making the current total 5 + 1  =  6.
The patient must be diagnosed with at least one of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the past for a PERC rule criteria to be met. The patient is reported to have been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in the past. The patient is not reported to have been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism in the past. At least one of the criteria is met and so we increment the criteria met by 1, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.
The patient note reports 'hormonal use' to be present for the patient and so we increment the criteria count by 1, making the current total 7 + 1  =  8.
Hence, the number of PERC rule criteria met by the patient is 8.

Explanation:
The current count of PERC criteria met is 0.
The patient is 49 years old. The patient's age is less than 50 years, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 99 beats per minute. The patient's heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The saturated oxygen percentage in the room is 95 percent. The saturated oxygen is greater than or equal to 95% and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note reports 'unilateral leg swelling' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note reports 'hemoptysis' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note reports 'recent surgery or trauma' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient must be diagnosed with at least one of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the past for a PERC rule criteria to be met. The patient is not reported to have been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in the past. The patient is not reported to have been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism in the past. Neither criteria is met and so we do increment the criteria count, keep the current total at 0.
The patient note reports 'hormonal use' to be absent in the patient and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
Hence, the number of PERC rule criteria met by the patient is 0.

Explanation:
The current count of PERC criteria met is 0.
The patient is 49 years old. The patient's age is less than 50 years, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient's heart rate is 99 beats per minute. The patient's heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The saturated oxygen percentage in the room is 95 percent. The saturated oxygen is greater than or equal to 95% and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note does not report a status on 'unilateral leg swelling'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note does not report a status on 'hemoptysis'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient note does not report a status on 'recent surgery or trauma'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
The patient must be diagnosed with at least one of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the past for a PERC rule criteria to be met. Whether the patient has been diagnosed for pulmonary embolism in the past is not reported. Hence, we assume it to be absent. Whether the patient has been diagnosed for pulmonary embolism in the past is not reported. Hence, we assume it to be absent. Neither criteria is met and so we do increment the criteria count, keep the current total at 0.
The patient note does not report a status on 'hormonal use'. Hence, we assume it to be absent, and so we do not increment the criteria count. The current total remains at 0.
Hence, the number of PERC rule criteria met by the patient is 0.
