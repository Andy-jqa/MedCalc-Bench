Explanation:
The current glasgow coma score is 0.
Based on the patient note, the best eye response for the patient is inferred to be 'eye opening to verbal command', and so we add 3 points making the current total 0 + 3 = 3.
Based on the patient note, the best verbal response for the patient is inferred to be 'inappropriate words', and so we add 3 points making the current total 3 + 3 = 6.
Based on the patient note, the best motor response for the patient is inferred to be 'localizes pain', and so we add 5 points making the current total 6 + 5 = 11.
Hence, the patient's glasgow coma score is 11.

Hence, the patient's glasgow coma score is 15.

Explanation:
The current glasgow coma score is 0.
Based on the patient note, the best eye response for the patient is inferred to be 'no eye opening', and so we add 1 point making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
Based on the patient note, the best verbal response for the patient is inferred to be 'no verbal response', and so we add 1 point making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.
Based on the patient note, the best motor response for the patient is inferred to be 'no motor response', and so we add 1 point making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
Hence, the patient's glasgow coma score is 3.
