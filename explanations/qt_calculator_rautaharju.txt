Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Rautajarju formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval x (120 + HR) / 180, where QT interval is in msec, and HR is the heart rate in beats per minute.
The QT interval is 400 msec.
The patient's heart rate is 75 beats per minute.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 400 x (120 + 75) / 180 = 433.333.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 433.333 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Rautajarju formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval x (120 + HR) / 180, where QT interval is in msec, and HR is the heart rate in beats per minute.
The QT interval is 350 msec.
The patient's heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 350 x (120 + 60) / 180 = 350.0.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 350.0 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Rautajarju formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval x (120 + HR) / 180, where QT interval is in msec, and HR is the heart rate in beats per minute.
The QT interval is 450 msec.
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 450 x (120 + 90) / 180 = 525.0.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 525.0 msec.
