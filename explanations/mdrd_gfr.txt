Explanation:
The patient is 50 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. 
The patient is not Black, so the race coefficient is defaulted to 1.0.
The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 1.2^(-1.154) * 50^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=64.087.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 64.087 mL/min/1.73m².

Explanation:
The patient is 60 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 60 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Creatinine is 60 µmol. To convert 60 µmol of Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 60 µmol Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 6e-05 mol Creatinine. To convert from mol Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 6e-05 mol Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.007 g Creatinine. To convert 0.007 g of Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.007 g Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 7.0 mg Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 7.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.7 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 60 µmol Creatinine/L converts to 0.7 mg Creatinine/dL. 
The patient is Black, so the race coefficient is 1.212.
The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.742.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.7^(-1.154) * 60^(-0.203) * 1.212 * 0.742=103.451.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 103.451 mL/min/1.73m².

Explanation:
The patient is 40 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. 
The race of the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race coefficient is 1.0.
The patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.8^(-1.154) * 40^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=107.067.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 107.067 mL/min/1.73m².

Explanation:
The patient is 70 years old. The concentration of Creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL. 
The patient is Black, so the race coefficient is 1.212.
The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.742.
The patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:
GFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient. The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.
Plugging in these values will give us: 175 * 0.6^(-1.154) * 70^(-0.203) * 1.212 * 0.742=119.785.
Hence, the patient's GFR is 119.785 mL/min/1.73m².
