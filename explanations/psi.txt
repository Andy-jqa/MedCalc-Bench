Explanation:
The current PSI score is 0.
The patient is 32 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 32 = 32.
Because the patient is male, no adjustments are made to the score, keeping the current total at 32.
Whether patient is a nursing home resident is not reported. Hence, we assume this to be false and so not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Neoplastic disease is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Liver disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
CHF History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Cerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Renal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Altered Mental Status is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
Pleural effusion on x-ray is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 32.
The patient's pulse is 120 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 32.
The patient's temperature is 36 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 32.
The patient's pH is 7.36. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 32.
The patient's respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 32.
The patient's systolic blood pressure is 91 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 32.
The concentration of BUN is 10.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 10.5 mmol. To convert 10.5 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 10.5 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.011 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.011 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.308 g BUN. To convert 0.308 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.308 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 308.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 308.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 30.8 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 10.5 mmol BUN/L converts to 30.8 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN is greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL, and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 32 + 20 = 52.
The concentration of sodium is 131 mmol/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 52.
The concentration of glucose is 13 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 13 mmol. To convert 13 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 13 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.013 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.013 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.342 g glucose. To convert 2.342 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.342 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2342.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2342.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 13 mmol glucose/L converts to 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 52.
The patient's hemocratit is 31 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 52.

The current PSI score is 0.
The patient is 32 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 32 = 32.
Because the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 32 - 10 = 22.
The patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 22 + 10 = 32.
Neoplastic disease is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 30 points to the score, making the current total 32 + 30 = 62.

To convert 0.308 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.308 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 308.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 308.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 30.8 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 10.5 mmol BUN/L converts to 30.8 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN is greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL, and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 177 + 20 = 197.
The concentration of sodium is 131 mmol/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 197.

To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.013 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.342 g glucose. To convert 2.342 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.342 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2342.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2342.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 13 mmol glucose/L converts to 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 197.

The concentration of BUN is 11 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 11 mmol. To convert 11 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 11 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.011 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.011 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.308 g BUN.

To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.014 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.522 g glucose. To convert 2.522 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.522 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2522.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2522.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 252.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 14 mmol glucose/L converts to 252.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is greater than 250 mg/dL, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 107 + 10 = 117.
