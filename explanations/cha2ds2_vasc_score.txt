Explanation:
The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.
The patient is 75 years old. Because the age is greater than 74, two points added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
The patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.
The patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 5 + 2 = 7.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 7 + 1 = 8. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 8 + 1 = 9.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 9.

Explanation:
The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.
The patient is 14 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
The patient history for congestive heart failure is absent. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
The patient history for hypertension is absent. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is absent. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is absent. Because all of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism are absent, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 0.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 0. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 0.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 0.

Explanation:
The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.
The patient is 14 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
Because the congestive heart failure history is not specified in the patient note, we assume it is absent from the patient. Because the patient does not have congestive heart failure, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
The patient history for hypertension is absent. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0.
One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Because stroke history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Because tia history is not specified in the patient note, we assume that it is absent from the patient. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 2.
The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 2.
