Explanation:
The current glasgow bleeding score is 0. The patient's gender is Male.
The concentration of hemoglobin is 15.0 g/dL. Because the patient is a male and the hemoglobin concentration is greater than 13 g/dL, we do not add any points, keeping the current score at 0.
The concentration of BUN is 12 mg/dL. The BUN concentration is less than 18.2 mg/dL, and so we do not make any changes to the score, keeping the score at 0.
The patient's blood pressure is 110 mm Hg. Because the patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg, we do not add points to the score, keeping the current score at 0 + 3 = 3.
The patient's heart rate is 100 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater or equal to than 100 beats per minute, we increase the score by one point, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient has melena and so we add one point to the current total, making the current total 1 + 1 =  2.
The patient has a recent syncope, and so we add two points to the current total, making the current total 2 + 2 =  4.
The patient has a hepatic disease history, and so we add two points to the current total, making the current total 4 + 2 =  6.
The patient has a cardiac failure, and so we add two points to the current total, making the current total 6 + 2 =  8.
The patient's Glasgow Bleeding Score is 8.

Explanation:
The current glasgow bleeding score is 0. The patient's gender is Female.
The concentration of hemoglobin is 150.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 150.0 g hemoglobin/10.0 dL = 15.0 g hemoglobin/dL. The concentration value of 150.0 g hemoglobin/L converts to 15.0 g hemoglobin/dL. Because the patient is a female and the hemoglobin concentration is greater than 12 mg/dL, we do not add any points, keeping the current score at 0.
The concentration of BUN is 5.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 5.2 mmol. To convert 5.2 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 5.2 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.08 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol BUN * 28.08 g/mol = 0.14 g BUN. To convert 0.14 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.14 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 140.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 140.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 14.0 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 5.2 mmol BUN/L converts to 14.0 mg BUN/dL. The BUN concentration is less than 18.2 mg/dL, and so we do not make any changes to the score, keeping the score at 0.
The patient's blood pressure is 90 mm Hg. Because the patient's systolic blood pressure is between 90 and 100 mm Hg, we increase the score by two points, making the current score 0 + 2 = 2.
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 2.
The patient has melena and so we add one point to the current total, making the current total 2 + 1 =  3.
The patient's status for recent syncope is missing from the patient note and so we assume it is absent from the patient.
Hence, we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 3.
The patient's status for hepatic disease history is missing from the patient note and so we assume it is absent from the patient.
Hence, we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 3.
The patient has a cardiac failure, and so we add two points to the current total, making the current total 3 + 2 =  5.
The patient's Glasgow Bleeding Score is 5.
