Explanation:
The current HEART Score is 0.
The value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Slightly suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'history', keeping the current total at 0.
The value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Normal'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', keeping the current total at 0.
The patient is 40 years old. The patient's age is less than 45 years and so keep the current total at 0.
The following risk factor(s) are noted to be absent from the patient: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, family with cvd, atherosclerotic disease. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 0 risk factors are present and so 0 points are added for the risk factors criteria, keeping the current total at 0.
The value of 'initial troponin' in the patient's note is determined to be 'less than or equal to normal limit'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'initial troponin', keeping the current total at 0.
Based on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 0.

Explanation:
The current HEART Score is 0.
The value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Moderately suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 1 point is added for 'history', increasing the current total to 0 + 1 = 1.
The value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Non-specific repolarization disturbance'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 1 point is added for 'electrocardiogram', increasing the current total to 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient is 60 years old. The patient's age is between 45 and 65 years and so we increment the current total by 1, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
The following risk factor(s) are present based on the patient's note: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking. The following risk factor(s) are noted to be absent from the patient: hypercholesterolemia, obesity, family with cvd, atherosclerotic disease. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 3 risk factors are present and so 2 points are added as 3 or more risk factors are present, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.
The value of 'initial troponin' in the patient's note is determined to be 'between the normal limit or up to three times the normal limit'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 1 point is added for 'initial troponin', increasing the current total to 5 + 1 = 6.
Based on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 6.

Explanation:
The current HEART Score is 0.
The value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Highly suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'history', increasing the current total to 0 + 2 = 2.
The value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Significant ST deviation'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', increasing the current total to 2 + 2 = 4.
The patient is 70 years old. The patient's age is greater than 65 years and so we increment the current total by 2, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.
The following risk factor(s) are present based on the patient's note: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, family with cvd, atherosclerotic disease. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 7 risk factors are present and so 2 points are added as 3 or more risk factors are present, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.
The value of 'initial troponin' in the patient's note is determined to be 'greater than three times normal limit'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'initial troponin', increasing the current total to 8 + 2 = 10.
Based on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 10.

Explanation:
The current HEART Score is 0.
The value of 'history' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Highly suspicious'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'history', increasing the current total to 0 + 2 = 2.
The value of 'electrocardiogram' in the patient's note is determined to be 'Significant ST deviation'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', increasing the current total to 2 + 2 = 4.
The patient is 70 years old. The patient's age is greater than 65 years and so we increment the current total by 2, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.
The following risk factor(s) are noted to be absent from the patient: hypertension, family with cvd. The following risk factor(s) are not mentioned inside the patient note: hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, atherosclerotic disease. Because these factors are not mentioned, we will assume that these are all absent from the patient. Based on the HEART Score risk factors criteria, 0 risk factors are present and so 0 points are added for the risk factors criteria, keeping the current total at 6.
The value of 'initial troponin' in the patient's note is determined to be 'greater than three times normal limit'. Based on the HEART Score criteria, 2 points are added for 'initial troponin', increasing the current total to 6 + 2 = 8.
Based on the patient's data, the HEART Score is 8.
