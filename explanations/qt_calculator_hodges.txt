Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval + 1.75 * [(60 /rr_interval_sec) - 60], where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 75 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 400 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/75 = 0.8.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 400 + 1.75 * [(60/0.8) - 60] = 426.25.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 426.25 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval + 1.75 * [(60 /rr_interval_sec) - 60], where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 350 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/60 = 1.0.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 350 + 1.75 * [(60/1.0) - 60] = 350.0.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 350.0 msec.

Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Hodges formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval + 1.75 * [(60 /rr_interval_sec) - 60], where QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 450 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/90 = 0.667.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 450 + 1.75 * [(60/0.667) - 60] = 502.421.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 502.421 msec.
