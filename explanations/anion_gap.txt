Explanation:
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.02 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.02 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.02 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.02 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.02 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.02 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.02 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.02 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 28.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 28.02 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 28.02 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 28.02 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.02 mEq/L - (100.02 mEq/L + 28.02 mEq/L) = 11.98 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.98 mEq/L.

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 112.03 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 112.03 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.03 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.03 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.03 mmol sodium/L converts to 112.03 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 90.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90.02 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90.02 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90.02 mmol chloride/L converts to 90.02 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 28.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 28.02 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 28.02 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 28.02 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 112.03 mEq/L - (90.02 mEq/L + 28.02 mEq/L) = -6.01 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -6.01 mEq/L.
