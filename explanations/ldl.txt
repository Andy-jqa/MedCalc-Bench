Explanation:
To compute the patient's LDL cholestrol, apply the following formula: LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL - (triglycerides / 5), where the units for total cholestrol, HDL cholestrol, and triglycerides are all mg/dL.
The concentration of total cholestrol is 4.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 4.2 mmol. To convert 4.2 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.2 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.004 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.004 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 1.547 g total cholestrol. To convert 1.547 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.547 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 1547.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1547.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 154.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 154.7 mg total cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of hdl cholestrol is 0.82 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 0.82 mmol. To convert 0.82 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 0.82 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.00082 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.00082 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.317 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.317 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.317 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 317.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 317.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 31.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 0.82 mmol hdl cholestrol/L converts to 31.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. 
The concentration of triglycerides is 1.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of triglycerides from mmol to mg. The mass of triglycerides is 1.2 mmol. To convert 1.2 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.2 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 0.861 g triglycerides. To convert 0.861 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.861 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 861.0 mg triglycerides. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 861.0 mg triglycerides/10.0 dL = 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL. The concentration value of 1.2 mmol triglycerides/L converts to 86.1 mg triglycerides/dL. 
Plugging in these values will give us 154.7 mg/dL - 31.7 mg/dL - (86.1/5) mg/dL = 105.78 mg/dL.
The patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 105.78 mg/dL.

Explanation:
To compute the patient's LDL cholestrol, apply the following formula: LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL - (triglycerides / 5), where the units for total cholestrol, HDL cholestrol, and triglycerides are all mg/dL.
The concentration of total cholestrol is 162.41 mg/dL. 
The concentration of hdl cholestrol is 31.71 mg/dL. 
The concentration of triglycerides is 106.19 mg/dL. 
Plugging in these values will give us 162.41 mg/dL - 31.71 mg/dL - (106.19/5) mg/dL = 109.462 mg/dL.
The patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 109.462 mg/dL.
