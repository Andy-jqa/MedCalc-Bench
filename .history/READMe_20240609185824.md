## License 

Depending on the calculator, our dataset consists of notes that were either designed from templated-based functions implemented in Python, handwritten by clinicians, or taken from our data Open-Patients. 

Open-Patients is an aggregated dataset of 180k patient notes coming from three different sources. We have authorization to use the dataset from all three sources. The first source is the USMLE questions from MedQA which is released under the MIT License. 
The second source of our dataset are the Trec Clinical Decision Support and Trec Clinical Trial which are available for redistribution because they are both government-owned datasets released to the public. Lastly, PMC-Patients is released under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 lisence and so we have permission to incorporate PMC-Patients inside Open-Patients and MedCalc-Bench, but the dataset must be released under the same lisense. Hence, our source of notes, Open-Patients, and the dataset, MedCalc-Bench are both released under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. 

Our dataset, MedCalc-Bench, complies with this license, but authors of this paper will bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights. 

## Reproducing Main Results 



## Maintenance and Responsibility 

Any additional new notes for new or existing calculators, will be updated both on this Github under the ground_truth_csv and the HuggingFace link.
