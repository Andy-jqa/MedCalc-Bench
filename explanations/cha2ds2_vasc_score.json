        "Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.\nThe patient is 75 years old. Because the age is greater than 74, two points added to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe patient's gender is female and so one point is added to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe patient history for hypertension is present. Because the patient has hypertension, one point is added to the score, making the current total 4 + 1 = 5.\nOne criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for tia is present. Based on the patient note, the patient history for thromboembolism is present. Because at least one of stroke, tia, or thromboembolism is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 5 + 2 = 7.\nBased on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is present. Because the patient has vascular disease, one point is added to the score, making the current total 7 + 1 = 8. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is present. Because the patient has diabetes, one point is added to the score, making the current total 8 + 1 = 9.\nThe patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 9.\n",
