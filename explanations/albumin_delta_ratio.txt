Explanation:
The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).
To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.
The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).
The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 140.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.02 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.02 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.02 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.02 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 100.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.02 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.02 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.02 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.02 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 28.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 28.02 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 28.02 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 28.02 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.02 mEq/L - (100.02 mEq/L + 28.02 mEq/L) = 11.98 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.98 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 4.25 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 11.98 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.25 (in g/dL)) = 11.355 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 11.355 mEq/L.
Plugging in 11.355 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 11.355 - 12 = -0.645 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -0.645 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -0.645 mEq/L / -4.02 mEq/L = 0.16. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 0.16.

The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).
The concentration of sodium is 112.03 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 112.03 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.03 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.03 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.03 mmol sodium/L converts to 112.03 mEq sodium/L. 
The concentration of chloride is 90.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90.02 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90.02 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90.02 mmol chloride/L converts to 90.02 mEq chloride/L. 
The concentration of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 28.02 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 28.02 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 28.02 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 28.02 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 28.02 mEq bicarbonate/L. 
Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 112.03 mEq/L - (90.02 mEq/L + 28.02 mEq/L) = -6.01 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -6.01 mEq/L.
The concentration of albumin is 42.5 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 42.5 g albumin/10.0 dL = 4.25 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 42.5 g albumin/L converts to 4.25 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -6.01 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.25 (in g/dL)) = -6.63 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is -6.63 mEq/L.
Plugging in -6.63 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get -6.63 - 12 = -18.6 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -18.6 mEq/L.
Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get -18.6 mEq/L / -4.02 mEq/L = 4.627. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 4.627.
