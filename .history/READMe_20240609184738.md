Depending on the calculator, our dataset consists of notes that were either designed from templated-based functions implemented in Python, handwritten by clinicians, or taken from our data Open-Patients. 


Open-Patients is an aggregated dataset of 180k patient notes coming from three different sources. We have authorization to use the dataset from all three sources. The first source is the USMLE questions from MedQA which is released under the MIT License. 
The second source is from PMC-Patients 

Our dataset complies with this lisense, but authors of this paper will bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights.
