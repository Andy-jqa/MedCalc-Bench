Explanation:
The current Centor score is 0.
The patient is 45 years old. Because the age is greater than 44 years, we decrease the score by one point, making the score 0 - 1 = -1.
The patient's temperature is 102 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 70 = 38.889 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 38 degrees Celsius, and so we add one point to the score, making the current score -1 + 1 = 0.
The patient note reports 'cough absent' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports 'tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes' as absent for the patient. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 1.
The patient note reports 'exudate or swelling on tonsils' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 1 + 1 = 2.
Hence, the Centor score for the patient is 2.

Explanation:
The current Centor score is 0.
The patient is 43 years old. Because the age is in between 15 and 44 years, the score does not change, keeping the score at 0.
The patient's temperature is 40 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 38 degrees Celsius, and so we add one point to the score, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports 'cough absent' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient note does not mention details about 'tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes' and so we assume it to be absent. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 2.
The patient note reports 'exudate or swelling on tonsils' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.
Hence, the Centor score for the patient is 3.

Explanation:
The current Centor score is 0.
The patient is 50 years old. Because the age is greater than 44 years, we decrease the score by one point, making the score 0 - 1 = -1.
The patient's temperature is 40 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 38 degrees Celsius, and so we add one point to the score, making the current score -1 + 1 = 0.
The patient note reports 'cough absent' as present for the patient. Hence, we increase the score by 1, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports 'tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes' as absent for the patient. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 1.
The patient note does not mention details about 'exudate or swelling on tonsils' and so we assume it to be absent. Hence, we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 1.
Hence, the Centor score for the patient is 1.
