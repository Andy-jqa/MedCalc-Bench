Explanation:
The current cardiac risk index is 0.
The patient note reports elevated risk surgery as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports ischemetic heart disease as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 1.
The patient note reports congestive heart failure as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient note does not mention about cerebrovascular disease and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 2.
The patient note reports pre-operative insulin treatment as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 2.
The concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL. The patient has pre-operative creatinine <= 2 mg/dL, so we keep the score the same at 2.

The cardiac risk index score is 2.

Explanation:
The current cardiac risk index is 0.
The patient note reports elevated risk surgery as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The patient note reports ischemetic heart disease as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports congestive heart failure as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 1.
The patient note does not mention about cerebrovascular disease and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 1.
The patient note reports pre-operative insulin treatment as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.
The concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. The patient has pre-operative creatinine > 2 mg/dL, so we increment the score by one and the current total will be 2 + 1 = 3.

The cardiac risk index score is 3.

Explanation:
The current cardiac risk index is 0.
The patient note reports elevated risk surgery as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 0 + 1 = 1.
The patient note reports ischemetic heart disease as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.
The patient note reports congestive heart failure as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 2 + 1 = 3.
The patient note reports cerebrovascular disease as 'present' for the patient. This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 3 + 1 = 4.
The patient note reports pre-operative insulin treatment as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 4.
The concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 3.0 mg/dL. The patient has pre-operative creatinine > 2 mg/dL, so we increment the score by one and the current total will be 4 + 1 = 5.

The cardiac risk index score is 5.

Explanation:
The current cardiac risk index is 0.
The patient note reports elevated risk surgery as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The patient note reports ischemetic heart disease as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The patient note does not mention about congestive heart failure and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The patient note reports cerebrovascular disease as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The patient note reports pre-operative insulin treatment as 'absent' for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.
The concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. The patient has pre-operative creatinine <= 2 mg/dL, so we keep the score the same at 0.

The cardiac risk index score is 0.
