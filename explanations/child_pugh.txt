Explanation:
The current child pugh score is 0.
The patient's INR is 2. Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.
The concentration of bilirubin is 2 mg/dL. The concentration of albumin is 3.7 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is greater than 3.5 g/dL, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.
Ascites is reported to be 'slight' and so we add 2 points to the score, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.
Encephalopathy state is 'Grade 1-2 encephalopathy' and so we add two points to the score, making the current total 5 + 2 = 7.
The patient's child pugh score is 7.

Explanation:
The current child pugh score is 0.
The patient's INR is 1.5. Because the INR is less than 1.7, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The concentration of bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 1 + 2 = 3.
The concentration of albumin is 3 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is between 2.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.
Ascites is reported to be 'absent' and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 5 + 1 = 6.
Encephalopathy state is reported to be 'no encephalopathy' and so we add one point to the score, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.
The patient's child pugh score is 7.

Explanation:
The current child pugh score is 0.
The patient's INR is 3.6. Because the INR is greater than 2.3, we add three to the score, making the current total 0 + 3 = 3.
The concentration of bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is less than 2 mg/dL, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 3 + 1 = 4.
The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is less than 2.8 g/dL, we add 3 to the score, making the current total 4 + 3 = 7.
Ascites is reported to be 'moderate' and so we add 3 points to the score, making the current total 7 + 3 = 10.
Encephalopathy state is 'Grade 3-4 encephalopathy' and so we add three points to the score, making the current total 10 + 3 = 13.
The patient's child pugh score is 13.

Explanation:
The current child pugh score is 0.
The patient's INR is 1.0. Because the INR is less than 1.7, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.
The concentration of bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. Because the Bilirubin concentration is between 2 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL, we add 2 to the score, making the current total 1 + 2 = 3.
The concentration of albumin is 2.5 g/dL. Because the Albumin concentration is less than 2.8 g/dL, we add 3 to the score, making the current total 3 + 3 = 6.
The Ascites state not specified, assuming and so we will assume it to be absent. This means we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.
Encephalopathy state is not specified, and so we assume it's value to be 'no encephalopathy.' We add one point to the score, making the current total 7 + 1 = 8.
The patient's child pugh score is 8.
