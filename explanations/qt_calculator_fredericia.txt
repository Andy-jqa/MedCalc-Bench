Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 75 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 400 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/75 = 0.8.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 400/√(0.8) = 430.887.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 430.887 msec. 
Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 350 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/60 = 1.0.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 350/√(1.0) = 350.0.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 350.0 msec. 
Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Fredericia formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / (RR interval)**(1/3), where ** denotes an exponent, QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 450 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/90 = 0.667.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 450/√(0.667) = 515.036.The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 515.036 msec.
