Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / √ (RR interval), where the QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 75 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 400 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/75 = 0.8.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 400/√(0.8) = 447.214.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 447.214 msec. 
Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / √ (RR interval), where the QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 350 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/60 = 1.0.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 350/√(1.0) = 350.0.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 350.0 msec. 
Explanation:
The corrected QT interval using the Bazett formula is computed as  QTc = QT interval / √ (RR interval), where the QT interval is in msec, and RR interval is given as 60/(heart rate).
The patient's heart rate is 90 beats per minute.
The QT interval is 450 msec.
The RR interval is computed as 60/(heart rate), and so the RR interval is 60/90 = 0.667.
Hence, plugging in these values, we will get 450/√(0.667) = 550.997.
The patient's corrected QT interval (QTc) is 550.997 msec.
